folder Structure:
------------------
app.js:- This file starts your web server. All your set up logic should be in this file.

config.js:- Node-config allows you to create configuration files in your Node application 
for different deployment environments.
config.js:- This file should contain all your configuration e.g. PORT number, secrets, 
keys etc. Do not commit this file to Git.

Controllers:- This folder contains all the business logic of your application. There should be a file 
for each type of control. e.g. If you want to perform operations on users there should be 
UserController.js file. If you want analytics there should be AnalyticsController.js.

Models:- All the database models should go into the models folder. Again you should write each model 
into its own file. e.g. User model in UserModel.js.

Public:- All the public files such as images, javascript files, CSS files should go into this folder. 
You should divide your files into their own folder.

Routes:- All your routing-related logic should go into this folder. Again divide this logic into 
multiple files based on functionality. i.e User routing functionality should go into UserRouter.js.

Views:- So this folder contains all your views i.e. HTML/ejs files. Drop this folder if you are 
building rest APIâ€™s.
